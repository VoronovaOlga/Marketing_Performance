### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the performance of the marketing campaigns for an AI-based application that offers life coaching sessions via text. Users can access the service by purchasing a subscription, choosing between two options: yearly or monthly.

### Goal

The Head of Marketing has requested a comprehensive report including the following:

1. Analysis of Marketing Campaign Performance
2. Key Metrics for Each Campaign:
   - Number of impressions
   - Number of clicks
   - Number of signups
   - Number of purchased subscriptions
3. Cost Per Conversion Calculation
4. Total Revenue Generated by Acquired Users (up to the end of 2024)

### Data Sources 

The database schema is located in SQLIII database, RAW_DATA schema, and includes the following tables:

- **USERS**: The table contains user_id, signup_date and the name of the campaign by which the user was acquired
- **CAMPAIGNS**: Contains daily marketing spend (cost) per campaign as well as the daily number of impressions and clicks
- **SUBSCRIPTIONS**: Contains data on subscriptions purchased by each user including user_id, subscription_id, subscription_type (yearly or monthly), subscription_start_date, subscription_end_date and plan_price
- **MONTHS**: Contains all the months of 2024

### Process Steps

####  Extracting data

I’ll be working in Snowflake and will start by creating CTEs to extract data from each table. Since the Subscriptions table doesn’t have the users’ signup_campaign and signup_date information, which I will need later, I plan to add this data using the Users table and join it on user_id.

```sql
WITH 

users AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM SQLIII.RAW_DATA.USERS
),

subscriptions AS(
  SELECT *
  FROM SQLIII.RAW_DATA.SUBSCRIPTIONS
),

months AS(
  SELECT *
  FROM SQLIII.RAW_DATA.MONTHS
),

campaigns AS(
  SELECT *
  FROM SQLIII.RAW_DATA.CAMPAIGNS
),

joined AS(
  SELECT s.user_id,
         u.signup_campaign,
         u.signup_date,
         s.subscription_id,
         s.subscription_type,
         s.subscription_start_date,
         s.subscription_end_date,
         s.plan_price
  FROM subscriptions s
  JOIN users u
  ON s.user_id = u.user_id
),
```
